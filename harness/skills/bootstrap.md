# Bootstrap

## Purpose

Onboard a new or existing project into K-Harness by filling state files automatically.
Solves the cold-start problem: users don't know which `.md` files to fill or how.

## When to Apply

- Right after running `k-harness init` on a new project
- When joining an existing project that has empty state files
- When state files are outdated and need a refresh
- When any agent reports "state files are empty"

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Project Discovery (read-only)

1. **Scan project root** for configuration files:
   - `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` → Node.js/TypeScript
   - `go.mod`, `go.sum` → Go
   - `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` → Python
   - `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` → Java
   - `Cargo.toml` → Rust
   - `Gemfile` → Ruby
2. **Scan directory structure**: List top-level directories and identify patterns
   - `src/`, `lib/`, `app/` → source code
   - `tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/` → test directories
   - `docs/` → documentation
3. **Scan for existing tests**: Find test files and map them to source modules
4. **Scan imports/dependencies**: Trace module relationships from import statements

**Do NOT modify any code files in this phase.**

### Phase 2: User Interview (interactive)

Ask the user these questions (skip any already answered by Phase 1):

1. "What does this project do? (one sentence)"
2. "What are the top 3 goals of this project?"
3. "What is explicitly OUT of scope? (non-goals)"
4. "What architecture pattern are you using?" (show detected pattern if found)
5. "Are there any type decisions or conventions the AI should know about?"
6. "What is your test command?" (show detected command if found, e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`)

### Phase 3: Fill State Files

Using data from Phase 1 + Phase 2, fill the following files:

**docs/project-brief.md**:
- Project Name → from package.json name, go.mod module, or user input
- Vision → from user answer #1
- Goals → from user answer #2
- Non-Goals → from user answer #3
- Key Technical Decisions → from Phase 1 scan + user answer #4, #5

**docs/features.md**:
- Add one row per detected module/feature area
- Status: `✅ done` for modules with passing tests, `🔧 active` for modules without tests
- Key Files: actual file paths from scan
- Test Files: actual test file paths from scan

**docs/dependency-map.md**:
- Add one row per module
- Layer: inferred from directory structure (domain/application/infrastructure/presentation)
- Depends On / Depended By: inferred from import scan

**docs/project-state.md**:
- Quick Summary: filled with current project state
- Sprint 1 stories: based on what bootstrap discovered
- Module Registry: summary from docs/dependency-map.md

**docs/failure-patterns.md**:
- Keep FP-001 through FP-004 as templates (Frequency: 0)
- No changes unless user reports known issues

### Phase 4: Verify

1. Present a summary of all filled state files to the user
2. Ask "Does this look correct? What should I change?"
3. Apply corrections if any
4. Report completion

## Output Format

```
## Bootstrap Complete

### Project: [name]
### Tech Stack: [detected stack]
### Modules Found: [count]
### Features Mapped: [count]
### Dependency Links: [count]

### State Files Updated:
- [x]docs/project-brief.md — [summary]
- [x]docs/features.md — [N] features registered
- [x]docs/dependency-map.md — [N] modules, [N] dependencies
- [x]docs/project-state.md — Sprint 1 initialized
- [ ]docs/failure-patterns.md — templates only (no changes)

STATUS: DONE
```

## Rules

- Never modify source code — this skill only writes to state files
- Always show the user what was discovered BEFORE writing files
- If the project has 0 source files, skip Phase 1 scan and go straight to Phase 2
- If a state file already has content, ask before overwriting
- Run this skill only once per project (or when explicitly requested for refresh)

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|---|
| Guess module boundaries | Scan actual directory structure and imports |
| Skip user interview | Phase 1 scan alone is insufficient — always confirm with user |
| Overwrite existing state files silently | Ask before overwriting non-empty files |
| Create perfect dependency map on first try | Start with what's detectable, refine over time |
