# kode:musher Reference

All skills, agents, rules, and state files in one document.

---

## Skills (8)

Skills are on-demand procedures. LLM reads the skill file and follows the steps.

### bootstrap

**Purpose**: Onboard a project into kode:musher. Solves the cold-start problem.

**When**: Right after `musher init`, when state files are empty, or when joining an existing project.

**What it does**:
1. Scans project root for config files (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
2. Scans directory structure and imports to detect modules and dependencies
3. Interviews the user: project purpose, goals, non-goals, architecture, conventions, test command
4. Auto-fills all 5 state files
5. Presents summary for user review

**Output**: Filled `docs/project-brief.md`, `docs/features.md`, `docs/dependency-map.md`, `docs/project-state.md`. `docs/failure-patterns.md` is left as templates.

---

### learn

**Purpose**: End-of-session wrap-up. Captures failure patterns and refreshes project state. **Run once per session, at the end.**

**When**: Before ending a chat session (recommended as the LAST skill), after debugging, after repeated mistakes.

**What it does**:
1. Reviews session activity via `git log` / `git diff`
2. Detects new failure patterns or increments existing ones
3. Updates `docs/project-state.md` Quick Summary (3 lines)
4. Updates `docs/features.md` if features were added/modified
5. Verifies `docs/dependency-map.md` for orphaned modules (Step 4.5)
6. Resolves `[STATE-AUDIT]` flags from reviewer (Step 4.6)
7. Updates Agent Memory (`docs/agent-memory/{name}.md`) with session learnings

**Output**: Updated `docs/failure-patterns.md`, `docs/project-state.md`, `docs/dependency-map.md`, and `docs/agent-memory/{name}.md`.

---

### pivot

**Purpose**: Propagate direction changes across ALL state files consistently.

**When**: Technology swap, scope change, architecture shift, goal pivot — any time the project's direction changes.

**What it does**:
1. Captures the change and classifies it (Tech Swap / Scope Change / Architecture Shift / Goal Pivot)
2. Scans ALL 5 state files for impact
3. Presents a change plan for user confirmation
4. Updates all state files in order: `docs/project-brief.md` → `docs/features.md` → `docs/dependency-map.md` → `docs/project-state.md` → `docs/failure-patterns.md`
5. Records the decision in `docs/project-brief.md` Decision Log

**Rules**: Never skip confirmation. Never update partially. Always record the "why".

---

### feature-breakdown

**Purpose**: Decompose a feature into dependency-ordered implementation tasks.

**Invoked By**: planner (Step 8)

**When**: Starting a new feature, a feature touches 3+ modules, unsure which module to build first.

**What it does**:
1. Reads `docs/project-brief.md` for Direction Guard (prevents breakdown of out-of-scope features)
2. Reads `docs/dependency-map.md` for current module relationships
2. Identifies affected modules and classifies changes (NEW_MODULE, INTERFACE_CHANGE, INTERNAL_CHANGE, TEST_ONLY)
3. Builds dependency order and groups into implementation waves
4. Creates numbered task sequence with files, tests, and dependencies per task

**Updates**: `docs/dependency-map.md`, `docs/features.md`, `docs/project-state.md`.

---

### impact-analysis

**Purpose**: Trace all affected modules before modifying a module's interface. Prevents cascade failures.

**Invoked By**: planner (Step 9), reviewer (Step 7)

**When**: Changing a module's public interface, modifying shared types/DTOs, refactoring 2+ files.

**What it does**:
1. Finds the target module in `docs/dependency-map.md`
2. Reads `docs/failure-patterns.md` for active patterns (FP-001, FP-002)
3. Lists all dependent modules (the blast radius)
4. Reads `docs/features.md` to identify affected features
5. For interface changes: traces each dependent's imports and identifies breaking changes
6. Creates a task list of all files that need modification
7. Verifies changes are within current Story scope (`docs/project-state.md`)
8. Updates Interface Change Log (mandatory — do not skip)

**Updates**: `docs/dependency-map.md` Interface Change Log, `docs/features.md`, `docs/project-state.md`.

---

### investigate

**Purpose**: Debug bugs systematically. Prevents "symptom patching" — fixing without understanding root cause.

**When**: Test failures with unclear cause, runtime errors, regression bugs.

**What it does**:
1. **Phase 1 (Evidence)**: Collects error messages, stack traces, recent changes. NO fixes.
2. **Phase 2 (Scope Lock)**: Identifies the root cause module. Reads `docs/dependency-map.md` for blast radius. Reads `docs/project-state.md` for Story scope verification (Iron Law #3). Excludes unrelated files.
3. **Phase 3 (Hypothesis + Fix)**: States root cause hypothesis, implements minimal fix.
4. **Phase 4 (Verify + Record)**: Runs tests, adds regression test, records pattern if applicable.

**Updates**: `docs/failure-patterns.md`, `docs/project-state.md`.

---

### security-checklist

**Purpose**: Inspect for security risks before committing code.

**Invoked By**: reviewer (Step 4)

**When**: Before `git add` or commit, when creating/modifying config or auth files.

**What it does**:
1. Checks staging area for forbidden files (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`)
2. Reads `docs/failure-patterns.md` for FP-004 history — if frequency > 0, applies extra scrutiny
3. Scans staged code for hardcoded secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens)
4. Verifies `.gitignore` covers sensitive patterns
5. Checks for temp files (`tmp_*`, `debug_*`, `coverage_*`)

**Updates**: `docs/failure-patterns.md` (if a security issue was found), `docs/project-state.md`.

---

### test-integrity

**Purpose**: Ensure test mocks stay synchronized when interfaces change.

**Invoked By**: reviewer (Step 3)

**When**: Adding/removing/modifying methods on a repository/service interface, creating new services.

**What it does**:
1. Reads `docs/failure-patterns.md` for FP-001 history — if frequency > 0, applies extra scrutiny
2. Identifies changed interfaces
3. Maps to corresponding mock files
4. Verifies every interface method exists in the mock with correct return types (FP-002: watch for type confusion)
5. Checks that use case tests configure the mock correctly for new methods

**Updates**: `docs/failure-patterns.md` (if mock sync was missed), `docs/dependency-map.md` (if module relationships changed), `docs/project-state.md`.

---

## Agents (3)

Agents are role-based personas that enforce the workflow. Each reads state files and follows a procedure.

### planner

**Role**: Feature planning, dependency analysis, Direction Alignment.

**When to call**: Before coding any new feature. "Plan [feature]", "What depends on [module]?", "I need to refactor [area]".

**Key behaviors**:
- **Step 0**: Checks if state files have content. If all empty → runs `bootstrap` first.
- **Direction Alignment**: Verifies the feature against Goals, Non-Goals, and Decision Log:
  - Goal → warn but proceed
  - Non-Goal → stop and ask user
  - Decision conflict → stop and warn
  If a direction change is detected → recommends `pivot`.
- Runs `feature-breakdown` and `impact-analysis` skills internally.
- Updates `docs/project-state.md` and `docs/features.md` with the plan.

**Referenced Files**: `docs/project-brief.md`, `docs/features.md`, `docs/dependency-map.md`, `docs/project-state.md`, `docs/failure-patterns.md`, `docs/agent-memory/planner.md`.

**Output**: Implementation plan with waves, dependency map changes, and risk notes.

---

### reviewer

**Role**: Code review + State File Audit. Finds issues and auto-fixes where safe.

**When to call**: Before commit or PR. "Review my changes."

**Key behaviors**:
- **Steps 1-5**: Architecture rules, test integrity, security check, failure pattern cross-check.
- **Step 6**: Feature registry check — new features must be in `docs/features.md`.
- **Step 7**: Dependency map check — new modules must be in `docs/dependency-map.md`.
- **Step 8 (State File Audit)**: Verifies that ALL 5 state files AND `docs/agent-memory/*.md` were actually updated. Flags missing updates as `[STATE-AUDIT]`.

**Referenced Files**: `docs/project-brief.md`, `docs/features.md`, `docs/failure-patterns.md`, `docs/project-state.md`, `docs/dependency-map.md`, `docs/agent-memory/reviewer.md`.

**Output**: Review result with auto-fixes, warnings, and pass/fail per category.

---

### sprint-manager

**Role**: Sprint/Story state management, scope drift prevention, next step guidance.

**When to call**: "Where are we?", "Story done", "Next task", "New sprint".

**Key behaviors**:
- **Step 0**: Checks if `docs/project-state.md` has content. If empty → recommends `bootstrap`.
- **Next Step Recommendation**: After every status check, recommends the next action based on context (e.g., "Run `learn`", "Continue Story S1-2", "Run `pivot`").
- **Scope Check**: Warns if a file modification is outside current Story scope.

**Referenced Skills**: bootstrap, learn, pivot, investigate.

**Referenced Files**: `docs/project-state.md`, `docs/project-brief.md`, `docs/features.md`, `docs/dependency-map.md`, `docs/failure-patterns.md`, `docs/agent-memory/sprint-manager.md`.

**Output**: Sprint status table with progress, next action recommendation.

---

## Dispatcher (1)

The dispatcher is always active. LLM reads it automatically — no need to invoke.

### core-rules (22줄 디스패처)

**File**: `core-rules.md` (global instructions)

**Contains**:
- 프로젝트 이름 표시
- 세션 시작 시 `docs/project-state.md` 읽기 지시
- 워크플로우 참조 (bootstrap → planner → code → reviewer → sprint-manager → learn)
- State 파일 목록 참조

**Not included** (스킬/에이전트에 임베딩됨):
- Iron Laws → `reviewer.agent.md`
- Direction Guard → `planner.agent.md`
- Testing Rules → `reviewer.agent.md`, `test-integrity.md`
- Backend Rules → `reviewer.agent.md`
- Health Check → 제거 (스킬에서 개별 확인)
- Completion Protocol → `reviewer.agent.md`, `sprint-manager.agent.md`
- 3-Failure Stop → `investigate.md`

---

## State Files (5)

State files persist project knowledge across LLM sessions. They live in the `docs/` directory.

### docs/project-brief.md — The "Why"

**Purpose**: Project vision, goals, non-goals, and Decision Log.

**Used by**: Direction Guard (every request), planner (Direction Alignment), pivot (source of truth).

**Key sections**:
- **Vision**: One-sentence project description
- **Goals**: 3-5 concrete, measurable goals
- **Non-Goals**: Explicitly out-of-scope items (triggers warnings from planner)
- **Key Technical Decisions**: Architecture and technology choices
- **Decision Log**: Records why decisions were made (Change/Reason/Impact/Alternatives format)

### docs/project-state.md — The "Where"

**Purpose**: Current sprint, stories, and progress tracking.

**Used by**: sprint-manager (core file), reviewer (scope check), planner (sprint context).

**Key sections**:
- **Quick Summary**: 3-line summary updated every session end (what was done / what's in progress / what's next)
- **Story Status**: Table with ID, title, status, assignee
- **Module Registry**: Summary of current modules

### docs/features.md — The "What"

**Purpose**: Living feature registry so LLMs know what exists in the project.

**Used by**: planner (what already exists), reviewer (feature registry check), learn (feature updates).

**Key sections**:
- **Feature List**: Table with feature name, status (✅ done / 🔧 active / ⬜ planned / ❌ dropped), key files, test files, owner

### docs/dependency-map.md — The "How"

**Purpose**: Module dependency graph for impact analysis.

**Used by**: impact-analysis (blast radius), feature-breakdown (dependency order), planner (architecture understanding).

**Key sections**:
- **Module Registry**: Table with module, layer, purpose, depends on, depended by
- **Dependency Rules**: No circular deps, layer direction enforcement, interface boundaries

### docs/failure-patterns.md — The "Watch Out"

**Purpose**: Project-specific failure log that prevents repeat mistakes.

**Used by**: reviewer (cross-check), investigate (pattern matching), learn (pattern recording).

**Key sections**:
- **FP-NNN entries**: Each with Occurred, Frequency, Cause, Prevention, Applied in, Status
- Pre-loaded templates: FP-001 (Mock not updated), FP-002 (Type confusion), FP-003 (Scope drift), FP-004 (Dangerous file committed)

## Templates

Templates are in `templates/` for creating custom skills and agents:

- `skill.template.md` — Skill file template with required sections
- `agent.template.md` — Agent file template with role, skills, procedure

---

## Team Mode

Team Mode(`--mode team`)에서는 개인 상태와 공유 상태가 분리되고, 멀티 개발자 협업 가이드가 자동 주입됩니다.

### 파일 분리
| 유형 | Solo | Team |
|------|------|------|
| Personal State | `docs/project-state.md`, `docs/failure-patterns.md` | `.harness/project-state.md`, `.harness/failure-patterns.md` |
| Agent Memory | `docs/agent-memory/` | `.harness/agent-memory/` |
| Shared State | `docs/features.md`, `docs/dependency-map.md`, `docs/project-brief.md` | 동일 |

### TEAM_MODE 마커
스킬/에이전트 템플릿에 `<!-- TEAM_MODE_START -->` / `<!-- TEAM_MODE_END -->` 마커로 Team 전용 가이드가 포함됩니다.
- **Solo**: 마커 + 내용 전체 제거
- **Team**: 마커만 제거, 내용 유지

### Team Mode 6대 규칙 (core-rules 자동 추가)
1. **Pre-Pull** — 공유 파일 수정 전 `git pull`
2. **Owner** — Story 테이블에서 본인 Owner 행만 수정
3. **Read-Only** — 다른 개발자의 Owner 행은 읽기만
4. **Append-Only** — 새 행은 테이블 맨 아래에 추가
5. **Pivot Lock** — `pivot` 스킬은 team lead만 main 브랜치에서 실행
6. **FP Promotion** — 개인 실패 패턴이 팀에 영향 시 공유 문서/채널로 승격
